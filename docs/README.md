New Year's Resolution for 2017: Make a D3 Block a day to teach myself D3. This is Number 19. This example
builds on yesterday's [USA district map](https://github.com/dbetebenner/D3_01172017) adding in the layer showing
state boundaries so that the map has better legibility. It also wires up the tooltip and zoom!
The visualization shows Alaska and Hawaii in the lower left
using D3's [geoAlbersUsa](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/master/README.md#geoAlbersUsa) projection.
The topoJSON files used to construct this visualization were created by me using
[shape files](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/geographicDistrictBoundary.aspx) compiled by the NCES and the United States Census Bureau.
[The Center for Assessment](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment) makes these
[state and national school district topoJSON files](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment/SGPspatialData) available
for anyone to use in their own development.
